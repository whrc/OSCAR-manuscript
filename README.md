This Repository contains the scripts and input files to run OSCAR (v3.0), a compact Earth System Model, as described in Treharne et al. . This repository includes the added modules to OSCAR that simulate abrupt permafrost thaw and emissions from below-ground combustion and fire-induced permafrost degradation. The repository includes the core files to run OSCAR v3.0, more details on that can be found under https://github.com/tgasser/OSCAR/tree/master 

**core_fct:** This folder contains the core functions of OSCAR

**input_data:** The input_data folder contains the **drivers** for historic and scenario forcings for emissions drive (E) and concentration driven (C). The **parameters** folder contains the parameter files for each specific run set-up, including a specific land surface model (e.g., JSBACH) used to drive the gradual thaw emulator and a combination of other permafrost modules that are switched on.
