This Repository contains the scripts and input files to run OSCAR (v3.0), a compact Earth System Model, as described in Treharne et al. . This repository includes the added modules to OSCAR that simulate abrupt permafrost thaw and emissions from below-ground combustion and fire-induced permafrost degradation. The repository includes the core files to run OSCAR v3.0, more details on that can be found under https://github.com/tgasser/OSCAR/tree/master 

**Input_data:** The input_data folder contains the **drivers**, **parameters** and **regions**

**drivers:** This folder contains the historic and scenario forcing files for emissions driven (E) and concentration driven (C) forcing. 

**parameters:** Each parameter file is for a specific run set-up, including a specific land surface model (e.g., JSBACH) used to drive the gradual thaw emulator and a combination of other permafrost modules that are switched on.
