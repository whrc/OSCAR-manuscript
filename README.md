This Repository contains the scripts and input files to run OSCAR (v3.0), a compact Earth System Model, as described in Treharne et al. . This repository includes the added modules to OSCAR that simulate abrupt permafrost thaw and emissions from below-ground combustion and fire-induced permafrost degradation. The repository includes the core files to run OSCAR v3.0, more details on that can be found under https://github.com/tgasser/OSCAR/tree/master
